### About Me

Welcome! I am a third-year (2022 Fall) PhD student of [Analytics & Operations](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/faculty-research/academic-areas/analytics-operations/) at [Imperial College Business School](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/), where I am very fortunate to work with Prof. [Zhe Liu](https://blogs.imperial.ac.uk/zhe-liu/about/) and Prof. [Chiwei Yan](https://yanchiwei.github.io/index.html). Before Imperial, I spent one year at [University of Washington, Seattle](https://www.washington.edu/) working with Prof. [Chiwei Yan](https://yanchiwei.github.io/index.html) (remotely). 
<!--Prior to UW, I obtained my bachelor's degree (with summa cum laude) in Industrial Engineering from [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://english.bit.edu.cn/) in 2021.-->


<!-- as a PhD student (remotely, quit because of the [US visa issue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proclamation_10043)) -->

I am broadly interested in **_operations problems involving incentive constraints_**, with a recent focus on **_marketplace & mechanism design_**, and **_information design_**.


I am visiting the [Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research](https://ieor.berkeley.edu/) at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) during the 2024-2025 academic year.
