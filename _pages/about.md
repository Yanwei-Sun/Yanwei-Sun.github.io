### About Me

Welcome! I am a fourth-year (2022 Fall) PhD student of [Analytics & Operations](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/faculty-research/academic-areas/analytics-operations/) at [Imperial Business School](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/), where I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Jiahua Wu](https://wu-jiahua.github.io/) and Prof. [Chiwei Yan](https://yanchiwei.github.io/index.html). I was a visiting scholar at [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) during the 2024-2025 academic year, hosted by Prof. [Chiwei Yan](https://yanchiwei.github.io/index.html). 
<!-- Prior to Imperial, I spent one year at [University of Washington, Seattle](https://www.washington.edu/) (remotely) working with Prof. [Chiwei Yan](https://yanchiwei.github.io/index.html). -->
<!--, where I am fortunate to be co-advised by Prof. [Zhe Liu](https://blogs.imperial.ac.uk/zhe-liu/about/), Prof. [Chiwei Yan](https://yanchiwei.github.io/index.html) and Prof. [Jiahua Wu](https://wu-jiahua.github.io/). -->

<!-- Before Imperial, I spent one year at [University of Washington, Seattle](https://www.washington.edu/) working with Prof. [Chiwei Yan](https://yanchiwei.github.io/index.html) (remotely). -->
<!--Prior to UW, I obtained my bachelor's degree (with summa cum laude) in Industrial Engineering from [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://english.bit.edu.cn/) in 2021.-->


<!-- as a PhD student (remotely, quit because of the [US visa issue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proclamation_10043)) -->

<!-- I am broadly interested in **_operations problems involving incentive constraints_**, with recent focuses on the **_platform operations_**, **_operational transparency_**, and **_prediction-based mechanism design_**. -->


Broadly speaking, my research focuses on _designing and operating modern platforms and market mechanisms in settings with **strategic agents** and **informational frictions**_.
My research has two primary thrusts: (1) **managing strategic interactions through the design of information structures and market rules in platform operations**, and (2) **harnessing AI-driven predictions to design more effective market mechanisms, encompassing both AI-assisted mechanism design and marketplace design for AI agents**.
